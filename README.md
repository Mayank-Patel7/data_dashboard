# data_dashboard
## Overview

This project performs an in-depth analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset using Python inside a Jupyter Notebook (titanic_data.ipynb).

The objective is to explore survival patterns based on demographic, socio-economic, and travel-related factors while building an  dashboard for visualization.

The project highlights practical skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive visualization — making it suitable for internships, academic submissions, and portfolio showcase.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Survival rate analysis across multiple factors

- Interactive dashboard creation using Plotly

- Exporting a complete HTML visualization dashboard

---

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains passenger details from the Titanic disaster, including:

- Passenger age and gender

- Passenger class (Pclass)

- Ticket fare

- Family relations (SibSp, Parch)

- Embarkation port

- Survival status
